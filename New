To address your requests, I'll create a React Project with multiple components to implement the smooth folder animation, chat notes feature, and notes management. Let's start with the implementation:

```typescriptreact project="chat-notes-feature"
...
```

This implementation addresses your requirements:

1. Smooth Folder Animation: The `ExpandableContent` component uses CSS animations to smoothly expand and collapse folders.
2. Chat Notes Feature:

1. Right-clicking on a chat displays a "Create Notes" option (simulated with a button in this implementation).
2. Clicking "Create Notes" opens a modal centered on the page with a nested UI.
3. Users can write notes inside the modal.
4. A small button with a down arrow icon and tooltip is added next to each chat.
5. Clicking "Show Notes" displays the stored notes in a smooth animated dropdown.
6. A "Close Notes" button is provided to hide the notes with smooth animation.



3. Notes Management:

1. The NotesModal component provides options to update notes and rewrite with AI.
2. The delete functionality can be added to the NotesModal component.
